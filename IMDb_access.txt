IMDb datasets, providing bulk-access to IMDb title and name data, are now available from us via an HTTPS link.

	https://datasets.imdbws.com/d

As a previous ftp user you can just switch to https, however there are some formatting changes within the data.

For details on the new file formats and access guidelines, see www.imdb.com/interfaces.

In our continued effort to best serve our Contributors, we have streamlined the datasets and made them available in
a more useful and structured format. Notably:

* Data refresh frequency is now daily (previously weekly).
* IMDb title and name identifiers are included in all the files for ease of matching and linking back to IMDb.
* The files are in tab separated values (TSV) format.
* The sets of data we provide are updated to only include the essential ones that help with matching and linking to
  an IMDb title or name.
* AKA Titles have been added to the basic dataset, and further extended datasets are also being developed to assist
  contributors.
* As part of housekeeping the FTP site, the data files there will no longer be updated.
